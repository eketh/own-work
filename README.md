My engineering thesis (unfortunately, in Polish) + engineering project + some photos to prove that it worked.
My project for my students organization: a device sending packs of impulses on DAC output. This version was sort of beta solution -later, I improved it and made it fully configurable via RS, however, the latter version resides somewhere in the very depths of C-2 building in Wroclaw University of Technology.
